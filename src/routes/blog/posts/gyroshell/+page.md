# Introduction to this post
Hey everyone! Thanks for joining me today. I'm going to be talking about GyroShell and what I have in mind for it. A few of you that are reading this may or may not have seen it already, but if not, check out my Portfolio and it will be over there to check out. Anyway, let's start with the concepts.

# Concept and design
I have recently made my away around to using Figma, a very popular and powerful software prototyping and design tool. With this being said, what better to do than to make a concept of GyroShell! Here it is in its current state (subject to change):

This is a very rough concept, and the custom start menu isn't even complete yet. But you can see where I'm going with this, mainly with the collections and modified taskbar.  The collections are a new idea I had, and it allows you to put apps into folders on your taskbar, and then the bar below them will indicate how many of the apps in said collection are open. Now, sure, I hear you "This looks just like Windows 11" or "This looks just like Windows 10". Yeah, you're right. This is the point of the default layout. If someone downloads GyroShell, I want them to feel at home, and so the default look will be pretty similar to Windows. Now, before you disregard what I said, lets talk about customization.

# Customization
So, you want a shell that you can make your own? Well here it is. I have already started implementing the settings window and customization menus. You will be able to change a ton once the shell is ready. From the transparency, all the way to the look and each square of the start menu. You will be able to customize it to make it your own, and all of your settings will be conviently stored in a .JSON file for you to share or modify. GyroShell will be everything you want, and more.

# What should you take away from this?
Whatever you want, really. GyroShell will most certainly not be for everyone, but for some of you, it's perfect. I will be maining GyroShell when it's ready. I think it's a unique, yet familiar design. Thank you for your time, and check back every once in a while!
